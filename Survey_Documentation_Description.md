# ISO Standards-Based Survey Documentation
## Etchon Water Rides Management System User Evaluation

### Survey Description

The survey questionnaire has 25 evaluation items created to assess how well the Etchon Water Rides Management System works from both user perspectives. The survey examines functional suitability, usability, reliability, security, performance efficiency, and overall satisfaction to confirm the system achieves the objectives of automated recording, role-based security, error reduction, real-time reporting, improved customer service, and staff accountability. 

The survey methodology follows a structured approach using a standardized 5-point Likert scale (1=Strongly Disagree to 5=Strongly Agree) to evaluate each item based on actual system experience. Participants are first-time users who perform typical tasks within their role permissions before rating system performance. The consolidated Excel workbook provides systematic data collection with separate Staff (11 items) and Admin (14 items) evaluation forms, organized by ISO quality categories for focused analysis. Response frequencies and calculated means enable quantitative assessment, while open-ended feedback sections capture qualitative insights for comprehensive system evaluation.

Testing all these areas through user feedback gives us confidence that the system works reliably and meets user needs at Etchon Water Rides.

### Survey Design Framework

The survey questionnaire is designed in strict alignment with internationally recognized ISO standards to ensure comprehensive and standardized evaluation:

- **ISO/IEC 9126-1:2001** – Software Engineering — Product Quality Model
