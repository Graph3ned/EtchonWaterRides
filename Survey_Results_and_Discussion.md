### Conclusion

The testing and survey results point to the same conclusion: moving from notebooks to a role‑based, real‑time system meaningfully improves daily work at Etchon Water Rides. All 39 automated tests passed, so the core functions—recording rentals, calculating totals, enforcing access rules, and generating reports—operate without error in controlled checks. On the ground, staff reported very strong experiences across usability (4.85), functional suitability (4.74), reliability (4.73), and security/performance (4.95), describing fewer mistakes and faster steps during a normal shift. The lone admin response (5/5 on all items) reinforces that reporting, oversight, and access control behave as intended, and that routine management is quicker than writing everything down by hand.

These outcomes align directly with the study’s objectives: (1) automated recording and monitoring of rentals; (2) secure, role‑based access for administrators and staff; (3) reduced errors and delays through digitized records and workflows; (4) accurate, real‑time financial and operational reports for decision‑making; (5) improved customer service via faster processing and up‑to‑date availability; and (6) staff activity logging to maintain accountability.

There are limits to note. The sample is small (9 staff, 1 admin) because few nearby rentals operate at a comparable scale, so continued feedback after deployment will be important. Even so, the signals are consistent: accurate records, timely reports, clear accountability through logs, and a simpler path to serving customers during busy hours. The system is ready for use, with sensible next steps focused on training, data migration, and watching real‑time updates during peak periods so we can keep tuning performance as operations grow.

### Staff Survey Discussion (n = 9)

Based on nine staff online survey responses we collected, the system comes across as dependable and straightforward to use during a normal shift. Results show rentals save correctly and duplicates don’t slip through (Functional Suitability 4.74). Usability landed at 4.85; in practice, staff said the dashboard makes it easy to jump to the right place, and adding or editing a rental takes less time than doing it by hand. Reliability scored 4.73: processing felt smooth overall, though it’s worth keeping an eye on update speed when several rentals start at once. The strongest signal was Security & Performance at 4.95—logins are clearly gated by role, and sensitive records stay where they should. Overall, the responses read like a calmer workday: fewer errors, faster steps, and confidence the system won’t get in the way when the line gets long.

For the admin side, we sent the same ISO‑based survey to the single administrator at Etchon Water Rides. It focused on Functional Suitability, Usability, Reliability, Security, and Performance Efficiency. Every item came back as 5/5.

### Admin Survey Discussion (n = 1)

The sole administrator agreed across all items (all were rated 5). In the survey, the admin agreed that transactions post correctly, revenue totals refresh as soon as rentals close, and filters surface the numbers needed for quick decisions. They also agreed that oversight is straightforward—rental activity and staff performance are easy to check, and the activity log leaves a clear trail when something needs a closer look. Managing staff, rides, and sales takes less time than writing everything in notebooks, and role‑based access keeps admin tools separate from staff views. During busy periods, real‑time availability and simple efficiency views help keep service moving. While this is one response, it reflects strong agreement with the system’s goals: accurate records, reliable reporting, clear oversight, and tight access control.
