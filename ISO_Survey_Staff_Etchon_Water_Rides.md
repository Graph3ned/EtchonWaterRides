## Survey Questionnaire for Boat Rental Management System (BRMS) - Staff User

This survey questionnaire is designed in alignment with relevant ISO standards:

ISO/IEC 9126-1:2001 – Software Engineering — Product Quality Model

ISO/IEC 25010:2011 – Systems and Software Quality Models

ISO/IEC 27001:2013 – Information Security Management

These standards ensure that the Boat Rental Management System is evaluated with regard to software quality, usability, performance, and data security.

Audience: First-time Staff users evaluating the BRMS.

Purpose: Evaluate staff-specific features based on project objectives:
- Faster, more reliable rental processing
- Secure access to staff functions only
- Fewer errors through clear rental workflows
- Real-time ride availability for better customer service
- Clear activity tracking

Respondent Scope Note: Originally, the target sample size was 100 staff users from comparable water ride rental businesses. However, we reduced the staff sample to 9 respondents due to the lack of suitable businesses operating at a comparable scale to Etchon Water Rides. Nearby rental operations (e.g., small paddle board rentals with only 2 units) did not require or utilize a system like this, making them a poor fit for evaluation. The final survey therefore reflects feedback from 9 staff users who align with the system’s intended operational context.

Instructions:
1) Rate each item: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree, 5 = Strongly Agree, N/A = Not Applicable
2) Answer based on your experience using staff functions.
